# MP_JBOT
This is the repository for the Jenga Building robot software developed to fufill the requirements of the MTRX5700 "Experimental Robotics" major project for 2021 Semester 1.

The project makes use of the ROS (Robotic Operating System) architecture to control a UR5 robotic arm equipped with an Intel Realsense to play a game of Jenga with a human being!

# Coding style
Please follow the style set out in the python script "Doc_example.py" for python code documentation. Don't get too worried about it but try and comment as best you can before each commit (mainly to save us from doing it later).

# Git stuff
Please document every commit as much as possible to avoid any issues with version control (i.e. finding the last version that works) so make sure that you state what you changed and a brief point on if the code builds and is functional or not. If it is not, mention what needs to be done.
